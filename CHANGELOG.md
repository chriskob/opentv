# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- **Guide detail pane** — highlighting a channel now shows its logo, what's on now with
  start/end times and a live progress bar, a synopsis when the guide carries one, and what's
  on next. Press to watch full-screen.
- **Live progress fill** on the current programme in the guide grid, and a focus highlight on
  the highlighted channel.
- **Fix: never asks for your provider again.** A cold launch could briefly decide "first run"
  before your saved sources had loaded and drop you on the setup screen — it now waits for the
  sources to load before deciding what to show.
- **Fix: no second video decoder on the guide**, which was locking up low-end boxes (a
  Chromecast could freeze). The detail pane is logo + guide info; the one decoder lives
  full-screen.
