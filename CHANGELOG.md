# Changelog

## 0.8.0

- **No more endless "Loading channels".** If a provider fails to load or comes back empty (a wrong
  login, a dead server), the guide now shows a clear error with **Retry** and **Provider setup**
  buttons instead of spinning forever.
- **Set up on a phone without the QR dance.** Installing on a phone now shows the login form
  directly so you can type your details in; the QR code is only offered on a TV, where typing is the
  painful part.
- **Paste into the setup fields.** The URL, username and password fields — and the on-screen
  keyboard — now have a **Paste** button, so a copied Xtream line drops straight in.
- **MPEG-TS or HLS, your choice.** Each Xtream provider now has a **Stream format** toggle. If your
  panel only serves `.ts` and channels wouldn't play, switch to MPEG-TS and they will. Defaults to
  HLS, so nothing changes unless you need it.
- **Parental controls scrolls.** The hidden-categories list is reachable to the bottom now, however
  many categories your provider has.
- **A real Channel Manager.** Settings → Channels is now a browsable, two-pane manager: pick a
  category on the left, see its channels on the right, hide or favourite each one — including
  hidden channels so you can bring them back. With more than one provider, a **source filter** keeps
  them separate instead of merged into one list.

## 0.3.0

- **Profiles.** Add local profiles (just a name — no accounts) from the person icon in the top
  menu, and switch between them. Each profile keeps its own resume points and watched state, so
  your half-watched film doesn't show as watched on someone else's profile. Existing resume points
  become the default "Me" profile's — nothing is lost.
- **Continue Watching.** Movies and Shows now open with a "Continue watching" shelf for the active
  profile — pick up your last film or episode where you left off, with a progress bar on each.
- **Local sync (no servers).** Settings → Sync copies your continue-watching between two OpenTV
  devices over your own wifi: one device shares behind a six-digit code, the other receives. It's
  local-only — nothing leaves the house — the household answer to the cloud sync that died with
  Viewella.

- **Proper player controls.** A single control bar slides up from the bottom with play/pause,
  rewind/forward (where the stream allows it), and pickers for **subtitles, audio track, quality
  and aspect ratio**. It hides after a few seconds and any remote button brings it back —
  nothing is ever left painted permanently over the picture.
- **Captions that actually show.** Subtitles are now chosen from the real tracks in the stream
  (and can be turned off), instead of a blind on/off that often left the renderer enabled but
  nothing on screen. Audio-track switching works the same way for multi-language streams.
- **Page through the guide.** Earlier / Now / Later buttons above the guide move the timeline
  forward and back, so you can see what's on later this evening with a remote.
- **Live preview in the guide.** The highlighted channel now plays, muted, inside the preview
  pane. It uses a single player that stops the instant you go full-screen or leave the guide —
  no second decoder — and it can be turned off in Display & playback for older boxes.
- **Channel manager.** Settings → Channels: search for a channel and hide it from the guide (or
  favourite it). Hidden channels drop out of Live TV and search but stay here, greyed, so you can
  bring them back. Hiding covers every quality variant of a channel at once.
- **Parental controls.** Set a 4-digit PIN and mark categories as hidden — they drop out of the
  guide, All channels and search until you unlock them (and with a PIN set, the parental screen
  itself is locked). In Settings → Parental controls.
- **Unified search with an on-screen keyboard.** Search now has its own screen with a d-pad
  keyboard (no more "type on your phone") and covers **channels, movies and shows** together, with
  live results as you type. Reachable from the top menu.
- **Loading indicators for Movies and Shows.** Both now show a spinner while the catalogue is
  syncing instead of a premature "nothing here".
- **Settings and Search in the top menu.** Both now live top-right, next to Live TV / Movies /
  Shows, instead of being buried behind the guide's icons.
- **A single Settings screen.** One Settings hub — Providers (add / remove / re-test sources), TV
  guide, Display & playback, Parental controls, and About (version, a manual update check,
  licence and links).
- **Dark / light / follow-system.** A new appearance setting. TV still defaults to dark; pick
  Dark or Light to force it on any device.
- **Quality picker only when there's a choice.** No more "Quality: Standard" on single-quality
  channels; the picker appears only when a channel actually has multiple qualities.
- New **Display & playback** settings screen (the sliders icon in the guide).

## 0.2.0

- **Guide detail pane** — highlighting a channel now shows its logo, what's on now with
  start/end times and a live progress bar, a synopsis when the guide carries one, and what's
  on next. Press to watch full-screen.
- **Live progress fill** on the current programme in the guide grid, and a focus highlight on
  the highlighted channel.
- **Fix: never asks for your provider again.** A cold launch could briefly decide "first run"
  before your saved sources had loaded and drop you on the setup screen — it now waits for the
  sources to load before deciding what to show.
- **Fix: no second video decoder on the guide**, which was locking up low-end boxes (a
  Chromecast could freeze). The detail pane is logo + guide info; the one decoder lives
  full-screen.
